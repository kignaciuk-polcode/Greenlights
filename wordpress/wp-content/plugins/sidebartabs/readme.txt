* Right-to-left language support. Special thanks to [Ardeshir Partovi](http://www.yataahoo.com/) that helped me as a beta tester of plugin in RTL. The scrollable layout does not work properly in RTL;
* Translation for language Persian (Farsi) fa-IR, done by Ardeshir Partovi. Included in this version;
* Changed the CSS class "accordion" to "sb_accordion" in vertical layout to avoid conflicts with themes and plugins that use this class.

* Small adjustments in the plugin interface.

= 2.2 =
* Created the option "Default arguments before and after widget of your theme": Some themes, without the use of  defaults arguments before and after widget, break the sidebar layout. Others don't work correctly with them. So I created this option and leave the choice up to each one. An excellent explanation this issue is the comment (#69) made by Clifton in page of plugin;

Of course, since the checkbox is checked to ensure that the widgets are not displayed again. Only the sidebar widgets to be below the instances of the plugin;
